## Unreleased

### Changed

- Tighten the draft storage contract (SPEC §6.3, ADR 0004): storage.set must
  reject a missing or top-level null value with -32602. Nested null remains
  permitted, and storage.get returns `{ "value": null }` only for an absent
  key. Implementations allowing top-level null writes must reject them to
  conform to this revision.
